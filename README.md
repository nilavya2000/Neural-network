# Neural Network from Scratch

This repository contains Python code to build a simple feedforward neural network from scratch, along with functions for training the network using gradient descent. The purpose of this project is to provide a clear and concise implementation of a neural network to understand its fundamental concepts and inner workings.

## Neural Network Architecture

The neural network implemented in this project has the following architecture:

- **Input Layer**: 2 input features
- **Hidden Layer**: 1 hidden layer consisting of 4 neurons
- **Output Layer**: 1 output neuron

## Usage

To use the neural network, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/neural-network-from-scratch.git
```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Enter the repository directory:

```
cd neural-network-from-scratch
```

3. **Run the Code**: Open the `neural_network.py` file and execute it using Python:
```
python neural_network.py
```

4. **Results**: The code will train the neural network using sample data and print the loss at every 1000 epochs.
